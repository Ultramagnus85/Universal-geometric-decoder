# 🔷 Universal Geometric Decoder

The Universal Geometric Decoder is a purely mathematical framework and simulation pipeline that extracts latent geometric structure from symbolic systems. It operates without speculative interpretation, relying strictly on dimensional consistency, spatial derivation, and symbolic transformation rules.

## 🎯 Purpose

This simulation decodes and reconstructs symbolic forms—whether in geometry, constellations, or theoretical fields—using recursive principles and optimization logic. It supports:
- Photonic surface modeling
- Sacred geometry reconstruction
- Stellar coordinate transformation
- Dimensional validation of abstract systems

## 🧠 How It Works

The system uses a five-stage decoding pipeline:
1. **Symbolic Abstraction** – Reduce inputs to mathematically defined primitives: points, lines, circles, spheres.
2. **Transformation Encoding** – Apply rotation, scaling, translation using matrix operations.
3. **Recursive Geometry** – Generate nested structures based on Mandelbrot and Julia logic.
4. **Photonic Simulation** – Model solar irradiance interaction with geometry using surface optimization.
5. **Dimensional Analysis** – Ensure all outputs obey physical unit integrity across domains.

## 🔷 Metatron’s Cube Integration

As a geometric scaffold, Metatron’s Cube informs symmetry alignment and recursive node mapping within the pipeline. It allows symbolic consistency across fields, ensuring all transformations honor universal geometric rules.

## 🧪 Mathematical Foundations

All simulations and results are backed by:
- Explicit derivations
- Symbolic matrix operations
- Coordinate transformations
- Gradient-based and recursive optimization functions
