# 🔷 Project Overview: Universal Geometric Decoder

The Universal Geometric Decoder is a mathematically rigorous simulation framework designed to reconstruct and decode symbolic structures across multiple domains—constellations, sprites, crop circles, and abstract geometries—using dimensional consistency, recursive pattern logic, and transformation-based encoding.

This system operates purely through derivation. Every method, module, and output adheres strictly to unit integrity and mathematical formalism. Symbolic features are translated into geometric primitives, examined for harmonic structure, and expressed through reusable transformation rules. These rules are then tested for universality across disparate symbolic systems.

## 🧠 Key Objectives

- Establish optimization and symmetry as domain-independent decoding principles
- Translate symbolic data into mathematically valid geometric forms
- Apply recursive and harmonic logic to identify latent structures
- Encode transformation rules with formal syntax and reproducible logic
- Confirm universality via cross-domain projection and validation

## ⚙️ Pipeline Summary

1. **Symbolic Abstraction**  
   Visual/symbolic forms → geometric primitives with normalized spatial logic

2. **Pattern Recognition**  
   Harmonics, recursion, symmetry detection → structural signature

3. **Rule Extraction**  
   Transformation grammar, matrix operations, subdivision logic → symbolic rule set

4. **Cross-Domain Projection**  
   Apply logic to other symbolic systems → evaluate consistency and fidelity

5. **Output Synthesis**  
   Documented derivations, reproducible results, validated dimensional outputs
