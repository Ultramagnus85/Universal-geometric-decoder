# üî∑ Project Overview: Universal Geometric Decoder

The Universal Geometric Decoder is a mathematically rigorous simulation framework designed to reconstruct and decode symbolic structures across multiple domains‚Äîconstellations, sprites, crop circles, and abstract geometries‚Äîusing dimensional consistency, recursive pattern logic, and transformation-based encoding.

This system operates purely through derivation. Every method, module, and output adheres strictly to unit integrity and mathematical formalism. Symbolic features are translated into geometric primitives, examined for harmonic structure, and expressed through reusable transformation rules. These rules are then tested for universality across disparate symbolic systems.
